# Ways of Working

## Definition of Done (DoD) for a ticket
A task is "Done" when:
- Code builds/runs (if code changes exist)
- Basic manual test performed and noted in the ticket/commit message
- Docs updated if behavior/usage changed
- No secrets committed
- Small, descriptive commit message

## Commit message style
Use prefixes like:
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation only
- chore: tooling/structure
- refactor: code restructure without behavior change
